SMTP Preprocessor
-----------------
Parses & decodes recognisable SMTP traffic, including any Base64 encoded attachments or text.

Section worth checking is "b64_decode_depth". This determines how much of the data is decoded. Valid options for this value are '-1 to 65535'

This is important because rich content in an email body will be encoded in Base64 and if you set a low value for the b64_decode_depth, you may never match on rules 
looking for data at the end of the body of an email.

Examples
If you're looking for a subject line that starts with ‘INVOICE’: Instead of using a standard content match: content: "INVOICE";

              content: "Subject:"; content: "INVOICE"; distance:1;

This tells Snort to look for ‘INVOICE’ 1 byte after the ‘Subject:’ line. We can use the same technique with ‘FROM:’ and ‘TO:’ lines to tighten our Snort rules.

Attachments
-----------
'file_data' option in a Snort rule can be used to examine the contents of any attachment after it has been decoded. 
The Base64 decode depth will come into play here.

So if we wanted to look for a RAR attachment within an email, we could look for something like this:
This looks for the RAR header at the very start of the decoded file

                                    file_data; "Rar!" offset:0; depth:4;

Complex Rules
------------
Looking for an email that contains a zip attachment from a specific email address could look something like:

                    content: "MAIL FROM:"; content: "support@helpdesk.spam"; distance:1; file_data; "PK" offset:0; depth:2;
