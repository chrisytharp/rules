DNS Overview
------------
The DNS operates primarily on UDP port 53.
Client issues a single UDP request to the server, which responds with a single UDP reply.

There are a few exceptions when the DNS will instead use TCP port 53:

            If the response is greater than 512 bytes
            Tasks like zone transfers
            Explicitly set by the DNS operator

When writing rules for DNS entries, it's important to understand how they appear in a packet. 
Content match of www.google.com will not work. There are no periods in the DNS; 
instead, each part of the domain name is prepended by the number of characters within that part (the length).

So a DNS packet for www.google.com would appear as follows:

          0377777706676f6f676c6503636f6d00

This is an important distinction, as a Snort rule with content: “www.google.com”; will not match these DNS requests. However, content: 
        
        “|03|www|06|google|03|com|00|”; or content: “|03 77 77 77 06 67 6f 6f 67 6c 65 03 63 6f 6d 00|”; 

will produce a match.
