SNORT 
IDS & can be IPS
can be active and passive (Active-live NW investigation :: Passive - look at pcaps)

Standard rule break down:
            [action]
            [protocol]
            [ip address] – source
            [port number]  – source
            [direction options]
            [ip address]  – destination
            [port number]  – destination
            [general options]
            [detection options]
Example
            alert tcp 10.10.10.0/24 any -> 192.168.0.0/24 443 (msg: “Test Rule”; content: “This is some content”; sid: 5000001; rev: 1;)
Actions
-------
define which action is taken by the detection engine, if a packet matches the rule. 
The most common 'Actions':
                          alert  -          generates an alert and logs the packet
                          log    -          logs the packet
                          pass   -          ignores the packet
                          drop   -          blocks and logs the packet
                          reject -          blocks the packet, logs it and then sends a TCP Reset or ICMP Port Unreachable Protocol

Protocol
--------
determines the type of traffic to look for. 
4 valid options:
                          TCP
                          UDP
                          ICMP
                          IP
IP Address
----------
The 1st IP address that must be matched
                          any               – a wildcard for any IP address
                          10.10.10.23       – any single valid IP address
                          10.10.10.0/24     – CIDR notation for block ranges
                          !192.168.0.1/24   – prefixing this field with an exclamation mark means ‘NOT’
                          [192.168.1.1,192.168.1.2,192.168.1.3] – comma-separated lists can use the previous syntax 
Port
-----
                          Port number syntax:   
                          any – a wildcard for any port
                          443 – any single port number
                          1:1024 – port range
                          1,443  - ports 1 & 443
Direction Options
-----------------
Sets the direction of the match. 
The valid options are as shown:
                                  <> bidirectional
                                  -> unidirectional
                                  
This is followed by another set of IP addresses and port numbers. 
Left-hand side SOURCE : Right-hand side DESTINATION

General options
---------------
Remainder of rule are within a set of parentheses. These are metadata of the rule. Known as key:value pairs terminated with a semicolon. 
Several options here:
                      msg         -  the message that displays in the log/alert
                      sid         -  unique numerical identifier that identifies the rule and has several reserved ranges
                      rev         -  annotates the revision of a rule
                      classtype   -  used to categorise and group common rules and has many defaults

Detection options
-----------------
This is where rules start to get complicated. 
These KEY:VALUE pairs instructs the scanning engine to detect specific data within packets !!!

Content
-------
Content keyword is the core of the rule detection. Can include TEXT, BINARY DATA or a mixture of the both. Content keywords are case SENSITIVE

Examples:
        content: "This is a string of text";      - STRING
        content: "|68 65 6c 6c 6f|";              - HEX encloed w/ pipes '|'
        content: "Hello |77 6f | rld";            - mix of STRINGS and HEX
        content: !"Not this one";                 -  '!' performs a negative match 'NOT this'

Behaviour of the content field is adjustable with the use of 'MODIFIERS' 
(Ea) content keyword can have several modifiers, and the modifiers will only alter the previous content option.

Some common modifiers include:

        nocase          - for case-insensitive text strings
        depth           - defines how far into a packet the match must be located. Depth of 6 tells Snort to check the first six BYTES of the payload.
        offset          - determines where to start searching for a pattern. Offset of 20 tells Snort to check for the content after the first 20 bytes of the payload.
        http_uri        - only match the content field if it appears in the NORMALIZED Request URI field.
        http_stat_code  - Restricts the search to the extracted Status Code field from an HTTP server response.
        file_data       - Applies to HTTP and SMTP xfic. The Snort engine will search for the content inside HTTP response bodies and decoded MIME attachments in email streams.
